# SpaceySpring-Seestar-Observations-Spring-2025
The goal of this project was to get familiar with the Seestar S50 provided by Howard University. This is so that we can make interesting events within the department using the smart telescope. This was also in cooperation with the NASA - via the DC Space Grant Consortium - DCSGC. All Files have a description. The start of the images descriptions would say Stacked or IMG (a stacked image that has multiple layered photos of the object and the IMG is one singular photo of that object which is usually for planets or moons). If its an image then it will have IMG_'a string of numbers that corresponds to what photo its on'.JPG. If its a Stacked Image it will have Stacked_'number of photos that went into that stacked photo''name of the object''the exposure time of each picture'_'IRCUT(infrared cut mode)'_The date-The stop time.jpg
