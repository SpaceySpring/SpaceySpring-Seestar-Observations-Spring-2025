# SpaceySpring-Seestar-Observations-Spring-2025
The goal of this project was to get familiar with the Seestar S50 provided by Howard University. This is so that we can make interesting events within the department using the smart telescope. This was also in cooperation with the Space and Science grant that I had received this semester and the summer.
